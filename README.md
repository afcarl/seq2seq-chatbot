# seq2seq-chatbot
An implementation of Google's seq2seq architecture.

I am also simultaneously [blogging](http://domkaukinen.com/tag/seq2seq/) about the process.

##How to Use

coming soon

##Examples of Usage and Training

coming soon

##A few notes:
- Much of this was appropriated from : [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn)
- This is based off of [Sutskever et al., 2014.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) and [Vinyals & Le, 2015.](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05869v1.pdf)
- The data this is being tested on is the OpenSubtitles dataset, I used [a script I made](https://github.com/inikdom/opensubtitles-parser) to tokenize and create the input output sequences
 

##Todo

- Add cross validation / test set loss calculations
- General bug fixes and testing
